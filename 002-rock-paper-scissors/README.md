This is a Python Rock, Paper, Scissors game project by Jan Grottel, started 24.11.2020.

Parameters:
Write a rock, paper, scissors game for one or two players. Implement a basic UI.

Elements that will be needed as of project start:
1. A basic 'type' system for possible choices and outcomes:
    a) a 'type' for rock paper scissors, includes only these options
    b) a 'type' for player_1_win, draw, player_2_win, includes only these options
While not strictly needed to implement the game aspect of the project, I know this is a possible thing to create so I want to refresh.
2. Function rock_paper_scissors on the types from point 1, unit tested.
3. A select screen for number of players (1 or 2)
4. A basic 'AI' bot that will select a random choice.
5. Object that's the main screen with two subclasses (?)
6. A main game screen for 1 player game, divided in two.
    a) buttons to choose your pick, on the left, instructions
    b) your choices are confirmed, message
    c) outcome screen with try again button
    d) running tally of results (unittested?)
6. A main game screen for 2 player game, divided in two
    a) instead of buttons, keyboard shortcuts for left/right side of keyboard. with instructions
    b) detect keystrokes
    c) your outcomes are confirmed
    d) outcome screen, try again button
    e) running tally of results
7. Probably a quit button somewhere.
8. Testing module - test the functions of the game if possible.
9. Any additional features are deemed unnecessary feature bloat at this point.

Things to learn:
1. Custom datatypes.
2. Basic UI - tkinter module. I have no idea how that works.
3. Design of classes for windows - inheritance of the main class.
4. Detecting keystrokes, waiting for outcomes.

And as always:
5. Designing the program first using functions, classes and pass statements.
6. Building the test functions second.
7. Coding third.
8. Commenting on code while coding.
