Parameters:
Write a dice rolling app with a basic UI.

Elements that will be needed as of project start:
1. A tkinter interface for the user
2. Input box for the number of dice
3. Input box for type of dice (d4,d6,d8,d10,d20,d100)
4. An ability to define multiple rolls like 8d6 + 2d8 + d100 - Add button
5. Feedback to the user - choices so far
6. Execute button
7. A list of rolled results, maybe sorted by type and then from highest to lowest
8. Sum of all rolls and sum of each die type roll rolls
9. Reset button, Quit button
10. Instructions
11. Testing module - test the functions of the game if possible.
12. Any additional features are deemed unnecessary feature bloat at this point.

Things to learn:
1. tkinter input box, with input sanitation, error message (?)
2. tkinter dropdown menu

3. Basic GUI design
4. Designing the program using functions, classes and pass statements.
5. Building the test functions.
6. Coding.
7. Commenting on code while coding.
